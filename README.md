# Warship-Game-OOP-Qt-

This is a 2D game created using the OOP paradigm. The game is a GUI representation of the Battleships game, adding 2 new ship types(i.e. submarines and yachts), and implements an optimized guessing algorithm for the computer's guess.
It was made using the Qt plugins for C++.
The game currently loads the board dimensions from the code, a config.cfg file will be added at a later time, to load these values externally.
